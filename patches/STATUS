isdn-utils/isdn4k-utils-3.27_20151118.patch

	I'm not sure what would be considered the upstream source for this
	package anymore.  There are a few related projects that appear to
	be almost abandoned.  I could not access the CVS server mentioned
	at https://www.isdn4linux.de/cvs.shtml.

	I think the official upstream might be

	git://git.misdn.eu/isdn4k-utils.git

	which isn't explicitly mentioned on the corresponding web site,
	and which I deduced by analogy to the CVS page.

	There's also a fork of the source at

	https://github.com/marschap/isdn4k-utils

	This patch has not been merged on either of these trees as of
	2020-09-28.  As noted below, the affected code originally came
	from pppd.

iproute2/0001-Use-SCOPE_HOST-default-only-for-127-16-not-127-8.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.

	This patch is meant to be used in conjunction with a Linux kernel
	patch.  It has been tested successfully.

linux/0001-Allow-0.0.0.0-8-and-reduce-localnet-and-enable-225-2.patch

	This was included in Linux release tag v5.2.

	The other parts have not been merged as of 2020-09-25, and
	correspond to other pending patches below.
	
linux/0001-linux-kernel-Allow-class-e-address-assignment-via-ifconfig-ioctl.patch

	This patch was merged in 65cab850f0eea, approved by David S. Miller
	on December 14, 2018.

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=65cab850f0eea

	This was included in Linux release tags v4.20 and v5.0.

linux/0001-Reduce-local-loopback-network-to-16-updated.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.  It is a more
	comprehensive version of 0002-Reduce-localhost-to-a-16.patch.

	In order to make the loopback network actually shrink to /16, this patch
	requires userspace changes in iproute2 and systemd.

linux/0001-Reduce-multicast-range.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  It is a narrower
	part of the functionality of
	0001-Allow-0.0.0.0-8-and-reduce-localnet-and-enable-225-2.patch.

linux/0001-Treat-IPv4-lowest-address-as-ordinary-unicast-address.patch

	This patch is new as of 2021-02-01 and has not been merged yet.

linux/0002-Reduce-localhost-to-a-16.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  It is a narrower
	part of the functionality of
	0001-Allow-0.0.0.0-8-and-reduce-localnet-and-enable-225-2.patch.
	It has been superseded by 0001-Reduce-local-loopback-network-to-16-updated.patch.

measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.

	It may require corresponding changes in the RIPE Atlas backend in order to
	request probes to test reserved address space (since scans that specify
	reserved address targets numerically are blocked from doing so by both the
	probe software and the backend).

linux/0001-selftests-add-IPv4-unicast-extensions-tests.patch

	This patch was committed on 2021-01-26.  See

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git/commit/?id=9b0b7837b9f1

openbsd/openbsd_class_e.diff

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.  It's closely
	related to, though narrower than, the FreeBSD patch.

openwrt/0001-Support-class-e-addressing-in-netifd.patch

	This patch was committed on December 16, 2018.  See

	https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/netifd.git;a=commitdiff;h=cd089c52de96e47cf99410f66701e04e24155b9a

ppp/ppp-2.4.7.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.  The affected code
	is apparently the origin of the code in isdn-utils (not that
	isdn-utils is likely to be updating its PPP implementation to match
	the original upstream pppd).

	The author of this code is my former Linuxcare coworker.

measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-12-07.

	It aims to make the RIPE Atlas measurement project's software probe
	capable of testing connectivity to various addresses that we're
	interested in.

pureftpd/pure-ftpd-1.0.46.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.

	The upstream developer independently made a related change that
	allows the software to use class E addresses, though still not
	class D addresses, on November 21, 2019.

routing/0001-Allow-Class-E-addresses-throughout-FRR.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  The upstream project
	is looking for revisions or actions from us.  See

	https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/3462

routing/0001-bird-treat-former-classe-addresses-as-valid-addresse.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  I'm not sure whether
	it was submitted to the upstream project or not.  See, e.g.,

	https://gitlab.nic.cz/labs/bird/-/blob/master/lib/ip.c

	(I need to do some more searches to see if this patch was ever
	introduced into the project's Gitlab instance or a mailing list.)

routing/0001-martians_check-remove-all-but-0.0.0.0-32-from-0.0.0..patch

	This is apparently meant to be applied to babeld (the name doesn't
	make that explicit).  This patch has not been merged as of
	2020-09-28.  See, e.g.,

	https://github.com/jech/babeld/blob/master/util.c

routing/0001-Relax-martians-check-in-babeld.patch

	A version of this patch was committed on December 22, 2018.  See

	https://github.com/jech/babeld/commit/19a442ba8df5db57c13a041501629c12ff9cef83

systemd/0001-Change-localhost-prefix-from-8-to-16.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.

	This patch is meant to be used in conjunction with a Linux kernel
	patch.  In combination with that patch, it lets a Linux system
	come up with 127.0.0.1/16 configured on loopback at boot time, and
	other 127/8 address available for regular unicast routing.
